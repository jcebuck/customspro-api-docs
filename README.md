Welcome to the CustomsPro API Documentation.

# Overview

This guide is to help you get started integrating with our API. More information about the product can be found here - [What Is CustomsPro?](https://www.channelports.co.uk/what-is-customspro/).

The API supports both JSON and XML formats. Just be sure to specify the appropriate Content-Type with your requests.

Swagger documentation can be found here - https://roroclearances.co.uk/swagger/index.html. You will need to check there to find root node names if you plan to use XML.

Additional global values, used by the software, such as countries, ports, and routes can be found here - [CustomsPro Additional Information](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rnjnCt48oIuF_pSxEWslt95k3DMBU5Kf31FTnoaTPQo/edit?usp=sharing).
